\ex. Who called?

Context: only Mary and John called.

\begin{itemize}

\item \alert{Karttunen} (weakly exhaustive answer): Mary and John called.

\item \alert{Groenendijk and Stokhof} (strongly exhaustive answer): Mary and
John called, and nobody else called.

\frametitle{Different predictions}

\ex. \a. John knows who called \b. Mary called. \c. John knows
Mary called. [K, GS]

\ex. \a. John knows who called. \b. Sue did not call. \c. John
knows Sue did not call. [GS]

\begin{itemize}

\item In favour of GS: suppose only Mary called. John
knows Mary called, but also believes that Sue called. Whould we
say that John knows who called? (Spector 2006).

\frametitle{Partition Semantics}

\ex. Is BUSH or JANET JACKSON on TV?

\begin{itemize}

\item Answers (GS): $\{BJ, B\neg J, \neg B J, \neg B \neg J\}$

\item Assumption (AE): the presupposition, if any, that exactly one of the
disjuncts should be true is not part of the answerhood conditions.

is on TV. \c. True exhaustive answer (GS): Bush is on TV and Janet
Jackson is not on TV.\pause

holds.

does not hold.

\frametitle{Summary}

\begin{itemize}

\item Karttunen's semantics is consistent with Schaffer's
predictions, but too weak to be adequate for knowledge
attributions\pause

\item GS's semantics does not support Schaffer's predictions\pause

\item In both cases, we ignored further restrictions on the space
of answers: for instance, it may be presupposed that exactly one
person is on TV.
